Appendix S2: Site-specific phenology definitions for each species included in this analysis and whether phenology measurements are recorded at the plot or individual plant level. 
Appendix S3: Group level estimates of Bayesian hierarchical models for the random effects of treatment (OTC-CTL) grouped by a) site b) species c) site:subsite and d) site:year from treatment only models for each phenophase. Estimates, standard errors and 95% Confidence intervals based on quantiles (brms default summary) are shown in days. Number of observations (raw data) included in each group level estimate is shown
