This is where all scripts for OTC analyses are stored. R Script workflow is as follows:
1. OTC_CTL_setup.R- pulls in all raw phenology data and does QA/QC. Writes out 'phenophase'.Rdata files to be used in OTC_int_cens_reg_scripts (#3) 
2. Climate_setup.R pulls in daily climate (temperature) data for all sites. Calculates site level temp averages (siteT) and year anomalies (siteyeardeltaT) based on average phenology windows for each site x species across years. Writes out climate_phenology.Rdata to be used in brms models  
3. OTC_int_cens_reg_'phenophase'.R- Separate script for each phenophase (green, flower, flowerend, disp, sen). Calls in 'phenophase'.Rdata, and climate_phenology.Rdata and runs two step (survreg,brms) hierarchical models. Saves model outputs as fitted.Rdata for post processing.
OTC_synthesis_results.Rmd-post processing markdown file (in Figures folder) creates tables and figures with model outputs.
