
Janet Prevey collected flowering phenology data at the Val Bercla ITEX site over the summers of 2014 and 2015

In 2014, OTCs were placed on plots on 6/10/2014, fairly soon after snowmelt. Day of snowmelt estimated to be 6/08/2014 - but not known exactly.										

In 2015, site-level snowmelt date was estimated from ibuttons placed on the soil surface at three locations in the site. 

On 06/15/2015 all ibutton temperatures changed from a steady 0 deg., indicating they were no longer covered in snow. However - we cannot be sure if that meant that the entire site had melted out, 
or just those three locations with ibuttons.

Phenophase definitions follow ITEX protocols. As plant species were rarely in all plots, For the flowering season analysis dataset I listed mean flowering dates from OTC and control plots, 
and those are the dates currently in 'ITEX_phenology_database_all'.  

Plot level greenup, first flowering, and last flowering dates are in the file here: 'Val_bercla_plot_level_2014_2015' 

All survey dates, including first and last visits to teh site, are listed in the data file: 'Val_bercla_plot_level_2014_2015'
