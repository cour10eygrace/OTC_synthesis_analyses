DATA SET OVERVIEW:

This file contains plant phenology data collected for the Toolik Snowfence
 Experiment from 1995 to 2001. The Toolik Snowfence Experiment (part of the
 International Tundra Experiment network) examines the short- and long-term
 effects of increased snow depth (shortened growing season) and increased summer
 temperature on arctic tundra vegetation.  The goal of this project is to assess
 potential changes in tundra plant communities in response to global climate
 change.

Time period covered by data: 1995 to 2001
Physical location of measurement: Toolik Field Station, Alaska USA
 (68.62710 N, 149.59322 W)


DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING:

Data were collected beginning at snowmelt and every 2 to 3 days thereafter,
 over the growing season from 1995 to 2001.  At three sites (moist tussock,
 dry heath and snowfield), a suite of species within experimental plots were
 monitored and various phenological events recorded (e.g. first leaf, first
 flower open, first seed dispersal, etc.).

DESCRIPTION OF SELECT VARIABLES:

SITE
USTOOLIK: Toolik Field Station, Alaska, USA; Comparative responses of moist and
 dry arctic tundra to altered snow and temperature regimes

LOCATION
Research site: Snowfences are erected and grids established at both a moist
 tussock site (68.62032 N, 149.59931) and a dry heath site (68.62261 N,
 149.59589 W).  In addition, monitored plots are established where a natural
 snowdrift occurs.  This site is referred to as the snowfield.

ZONE
Snow manipulation: A 60 m snowfence is aligned on an east-west axis at both the
 moist and dry sites. Both snowfences are perpendicular to the predominant
 winter winds from the Brooks Range to the south, effectively creating a
 leeward drift 50-60 m long on the north side of the fence.  An established
 grid on the north side of the fence divides the drift into 6 parallel zones
 (60 m x 10 m).  Zone number increases from 1 to 6, as distance from the
 snowfence increases.  Zones 1, 2 and 3 accumulate the most snow (2-3 m), while
 zones 4, 5 and 6 accumulate the least snow (0.5-2 m).  Zone 0 (the control) is
 located adjacent to the snowfence grid and does not receive supplemental snow.

TREATMENT
ITEX temperature manipulation.  OTC: Open-topped chamber (warming), CTL: No
 chamber (control)

SUPPLEMENT
An "S" in this column indicates data was collected from a plot supplemental to
 the original.

CODE
See associated species file (USTOOLIK_specieslist.txt) for species code
 definitions.

PHENOLOGICAL EVENTS
Event definitions vary depending on plant growth form.  For precise definitions,
 contact the principal investigator.

An "AAA" in an event column indicates the plant aborted reproduction at this 
stage.

CODES USED IN DATA SET
In all years "-9999" indicates missing data.


DATA REMARKS:

Snow free dates were estimated for several plots in 1998 and 1999.  Refer to
 associated snow free data file (USTOOLIK_snowfree95-01.txt) to identify these
 plots.
