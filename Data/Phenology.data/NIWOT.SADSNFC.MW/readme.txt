Methods:"The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) is a consortium of research sites seeking to understand the response of tundra plant populations to changes in growing season temperatures through a simple temperature manipulation and transplant experiment. The research goal is to examine the phenologic and reproductive responses of a set of species to experimentally-induced warming at a network of sites. The ITEX design is hierarchical, with sites participating at whatever level they are able. At the minimum, participation in ITEX requires climate monitoring (using the LTER MSR standards), a temperature manipulation using one of three possible designs, and monitoring phenologic and reproductive variables for at least one designated ITEX species or two other species. The temperature manipulation is achieved through use of conical or hexagonal open-top chambers of solar fiberglass, which have been shown to increase the air temperature at the surface approximately 3 degrees C. ITEX studies at Niwot Ridge, a logical outgrowth of the long-term phenology studies there, uses a factorial design based around the long-term snowfence experiment. Twenty cones are placed behind the snowfence, distributed at 10, 25, 45, and 75 m from the fence; each cone is paired with an adjacent plot. Beginning with the 1995 season, 24 additional plots were implemented outside of the snowfence influence. Twelve cones are distributed beyond both the north and south edges of the snowfence area, at 10, 25, 45, and 75 m behind the line of the snowfence; each cone is paired with an adjacent plot. This results in the following treatments: increased winter snow, increased summer temperature, increased snow and increased temperature, and control.  Key phenologic, growth, and reproductive traits are being followed on marked individuals of Acomastylis (Geum) rossii and Bistorta (Polygonum) bistortoides, and complete species composition is being monitored.

The snowfence was oriented in a north-south direction and all of the study plots were located east of the snowfence. Each of the experimental plots had a control plot associated with it. Each plot had a x coordinate (distance (m) east of the snowfence) and a y coordinate (distance (m) north of the baseline across the southern boundary of the snowfence experimental area). The rows of square meter plots directly east and directly north of (but adjacent to) the snowfence and baseline, respectively, were given x and y coordinates, respectively, of 01. 
The plots and their respective coordinates were:
10-1E(10,15), 10-1C(09,14), 10-2E(10,25), 10-2C(09,24), 10-3E(10,30),
10-3C(10,31), 10-4E(10,41), 10-4C(09,40), 10-5E(10,44), 10-5C(09,45),
25-1E(25,23), 25-1C(24,22), 25-2E(25,25), 25-2C(24,24), 25-3E(25,30),
25-3C(24,29), 25-4E(25,32), 25-4C(24,31), 25-5E(25,39), 25-5C(24,38),
45-1E(45,03), 45-1C(44,04), 45-2E(45,06), 45-2C(44,07), 45-3E(45,15),
45-3C(45,16), 45-4E(45,31), 45-4C(44,32), 45-5E(45,47), 45-5C(45,48),
75-1E(75,03), 75-1C(74,04), 75-2E(75,21), 75-2C(74,22), 75-3E(75,24),
75-3C(74,25), 75-4E(75,43), 75-4C(75,42), 75-5E(75,45), 75-5C(74,46).
The plots added in 1995 that are external to the snowfence influence have an EP prefix to their plot codes, and the following coordinates:
EP10-1E(10,-12), EP10-1C(10,-11), EP10-2E(09,087),
EP10-2C(09,088), EP10-3E(09,093), EP10-3C(09,094),
EP25-1E(26,-14), EP25-1C(26,-12), EP25-2E(25,-11),
EP25-2C(26,-10), EP25-3E(25,073), EP25-3C(25,072),
EP45-1E(44,-09), EP45-1C(43,-08), EP45-2E(44,-07),
EP45-2C(45,-06), EP45-3E(44,073), EP45-3C(45,073),
EP75-1E(74,-07), EP75-1C(75,-08), EP75-2E(75,071),
EP75-2C(75,069), EP75-3E(74,074), EP75-3C(75,074).
AR and BB in column 3 of the data section refer to Acomastylis rossii and Bistorta bistortoides plants, respectively. Experimental and control plots are designated, within the plot code, by the letters E and C, respectively.
Phenological stages with values of 'A' indicate that the plant aborted during that given stage.
If a given phenological state for a plant had already occurred at the time of the first observation, no date was recorded for that state during 1993. In 1994, however, the '<' symbol preceding the date of first observance was used to indicate that a given phenological state had occurred at sometime prior to that date. Thus, there are substantially more "missing" data for 1993. The data received for 1995 did not include any '<' qualifiers. After consultation with field personnel, it was determined that all the 1995 first snow free and first leaf evident dates represent the day on which the respective phenological stage was reached. All other 1995 dates are assumed to indicate that the plant reached the given phenological state on or before the date recorded. The data for 1996 were recorded in the same manner as the 1995 data.
