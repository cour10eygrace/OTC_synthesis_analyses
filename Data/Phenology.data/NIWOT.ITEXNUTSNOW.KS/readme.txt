NWT ITEX, N Snow readme start, email from J. Smith 9/26/2019: 
I was working on the ridge throughout the summer of 2008 and we (Suding lab) definitely didn’t get any phenology data from Marilyn Walker’s ITEX plots on the Saddle — I’m not even sure where those plots are. However, I remember there was a grad student from CSU, Aaron someone, who maybe could have looked at the Walker plots. His main experiment was manipulating snowmelt timing in some plots he established north of the saddle, which seems like it could have been phenology-related. Either Katie or Bill would probably remember who Aaron was working with at CSU.

Attached is the phenology data we collected from the ITEX exp. in 2007 and 2008. The raw data from 2007 actually shows what at phenological stage (vegetative or flowering) each species was in plots at numerous survey dates. For 2008, we only recorded first flowering date. We also did a count of flower number. What’s written in the methods is:

"During the summer of 2007, plots were visited 1-2 times a week. We recorded first flowering date (FFD) and length of flowering season for all species present in plots (20 forbs, 8 graminoids). For the first month, vegetative state was also recorded for non-flowering species, but, due to time constraints, in late June we started collecting only flowering data. Flowering has been found to be the phenophase of alpine plants most responsive to temperature changes (Hülber et al., 2010). Flower surveys were conducted every 2 to 9 days, but most (~70%) occurred 2 to 4 days apart and, within the range of FFDs for species considered here, the longest time between surveys was one six-day gap. Species were recorded as flowering when the first flower/inflorescence appeared from any individual of the relevant species in a subplot. Most species were considered flowering when petals were open enough for reproductive structures to be visible. Bistorta species have inflorescences with flowers too small for reproductive structures to be easily seen with the naked eye; these species were recorded as flowering when flowers’ petals covered at least 50% of the inflorescence. Grass species were considered flowering when at least one spikelet of the inflorescence was no longer enclosed by the leaf sheath. In 2007 survey dates were May 30; June 4, 11, 13, 15, 19, 25, 28; July 2, 6, 9, 12, 16, 19, 23, 26, 31; August 2, 6, 13, 22. 
 In 2008 observations were limited to FFD for five of the most abundant species at our site (Bistorta bistortoides, Caltha leptosepala, Carex scopulorum, Deschampsia caespitosa, Geum rossii), those present in enough plots to provide adequate data for individual analyses. Flower surveys were conducted every 1 to 6 days, but most (~70%) occurred 1 to 4 days apart with only one six-day gap between surveys. In 2008 survey dates were June 10, 13, 16, 17, 19, 24, 30; July 1, 3, 8, 11, 16, 21, 25, 26, 28.
 On July 16, 2007, the number of flowers/inflorescences of four dominant species, G. rossii, B. bistortoides, Artemisia scopulorum and D. caespitosa, was counted in plots shortly after peak flowering when new flowers/inflorescences were unlikely to open but senesced flowers were still visible. In 2008, the number of flowers/inflorescences of G. rossii, B. bistortoides, and D. caespitosa  was counted on 8/7/2008."
 
The data files I’m sending you are:
NWT_ITEX_FFD_data_2007-8.xlsx — summary of FFD for all species recorded in 2007 and 2008. There’s a worksheet for all plots and a worksheet for just control and snow addition plots (data that Prevey wanted). 

NWT_ITEX_FFD_forPrevey.xlsx — data that I sent to Prevey (same stuff as in previous file but in different format and with additional location and climate info).

Niwot_Salix_07_Phenology_Raw.xls — raw phenology data for 2007.

Niwot_Salix_07_Phenology_Flower Number.xls — flower number in each plot in 2007.

Niwot_Salix_08_Phenology.xls — raw FFD for 2008. ***some FFD for BISVIV are noted in the BISBIS column - BISVIV flower timing is totally different from BISBIS and BISVIV dates should not be used for BISBIS!!***

Niwot_Salix_08_Flower_Number.xls — flower number in each plot in 2008.
