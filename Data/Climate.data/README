This is where all climate data are stored. Daily climate data from local weather stations at or near each site are in the 'ITEX_daily_climate_data.csv' and infilled climate data are in the infilled_data folder. Site-years of climate data used are in site_years.csv. Site name 'Barrow' was renamed to 'Utqiagvik'
These data are used to calculate species-specific climate windows in the Climate_setup.R script and saved as climate_phenology.Rdata for future analyses. 
Available snowmelt data are stored in the snowfree_data.csv and used to test the effect of OTCs on snowmelt dates in year round OTC sites in the snow_free.R script.
