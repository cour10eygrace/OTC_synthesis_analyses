 Missing climate data from ITEX_daily_climate_data.csv were infilled from downloaded ERA climate data based off subsite level coordinates listed in Data/LOOKUPS/subsites.csv. We infilled using the methodology described in Kittel et al. (2015) and If model selection failed to pick a best model based off of this method, we used the long-term (multi-year) method to infill (see Kittel et al. 2015 Appendix B). infilled_daily_climate_data.csv contains all records in any subsite-year that had infilling and infilled_daily_climate_data_missingdates.csv contains only the missing dates of that subsites year that were infilled.
